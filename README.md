The objective of Gaussian naive Bayes classification is to accurately 
classify instances into predefined classes. It assumes that the features 
are independent and follow a Gaussian distribution within each class. 
The classifier aims to estimate the class conditional probability density 
function using the training data and applies Bayes' theorem to applying
calculate the posterior probability of each class. The class with the 
highest posterior probability is assigned as the predicted class. The The highest
overall objective is to build a probabilistic model that can generalize 
well with unseen data and accurately classify instances based on the 
learned class distributions and feature independence assumptions.
